# Nasa Cyber Attack

### Background

NASA is a regular target of cyber-attacks due in part to its high-profile missions, the sizeable publicfacing digital footprint, and the often sensitive nature of the information these systems manage. Given
its online presence of approximately 3,000 websites and more than 42,000 publicly accessible datasets,
the Agency is highly vulnerable to intrusions. This year in particular NASA has experienced an uptick in
cyber threats: phishing attempts have doubled and malware attacks have increased exponentially during
the COVID-19 pandemic and the concomitant move to telework for much of the NASA workforce. The
Agency’s cybersecurity challenges are further exacerbated by the number and variety of IT devices at
NASA and the sheer volume of data the Agency maintains.

### What Happened?

A hack at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 2018, for example, resulted from an account belonging to an external user connecting an unauthorized device to JPL servers that inadvertently exposed the network to hackers, who then infiltrated the system and accessed the servers as well as NASA's Deep Space Network.

### Conclussion

Attacks on NASA networks are not a new phenomenon, although attempts to steal critical information
are increasing in both complexity and severity. As attackers become more aggressive, organized, and
sophisticated, managing and mitigating cybersecurity risk is critical to protecting NASA’s vast network of
information technology systems from malicious attacks or breaches that can seriously inhibit the
Agency’s ability to carry out its mission. Although NASA has taken positive steps to address
cybersecurity in the areas of network monitoring, identity management, and updating its IT Strategic
Plan, it continues to face challenges in strengthening the foundational cybersecurity efforts related to
EA and modernizing the A&A process. Specifically, the Agency’s cybersecurity preparedness is strained
due to ambiguity surrounding the requisite technical integration between EA/ESA, gaps in mission
visibility, and inconsistent and ineffective practices around the A&A process. When system owners view
A&A as a burden rather than a benefit, poor risk management decisions are inevitable.
